## 📋 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **M2 Scoring Course**.It implements a complete credit scoring pipeline to predict corporate financial difficulty (`yd`) based on a dataset of 181 firms. This analysis is based on the work of Edward I. Altman "Financial Ratios, Discriminant Analysis and the Prediction of Corporate Bankruptcy" in 1968. The analysis follows a rigorous econometric approach, comparing **Linear Probability (LPM)**, **Logit**, and **Probit** models.

## 👨‍💻 Replication
Part of this project involves using an LLM to replicate the original code I wrote in other languages and to correct it. You will find an R file that does the same thing than the code I wrote in Python. To replicate the original paper from Altman, I have to answer 24 questions about the transformation and analysis of data. I am required to use the even rows as training data and the odd rows as validation data.
